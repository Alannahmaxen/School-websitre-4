"I’ve been a student at HFS International since 8th grade in 2015. Over the course of 5 years,<br> HFS International has provided me a number of opportunities for me to explore my interests and find the most suitable for me in terms of academics. <br>It was due to the amazing teachers and their teaching style which got me interested in the subject of my choice: economics.<br> HFS also let me explore my interests in extra-curriculars by introducing me to a wide variety of options over the years such as MUNs and Basketball.<br> Due to the constant support of the teachers, I was able to become part of the basketball team from grades 9 – 12 and was the honored with the position as the School MUN Secretary in my final year."</p>

As soon as I made this decision, I knew that I wanted to do it in HFS international because of its well known reputation. I have met the most supportive teachers and the most supportive principal here. HFS made me feel like I was a part of a huge family and made me comfortable. I have learnt a lot of things, even if I took too long to understand something, the teachers would sit with me until I understand the concept. I am extremely thankful to everyone to HFSI for building me as a person."</p>
